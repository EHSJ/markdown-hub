# Markdown Hub

Markdown Hub is a hub to publish Markdown and subscribe HTML, which is built on:

* [github-markdown](https://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown) as a Markdown renderer
* [sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) for the look-and-feel like github.com

Markdown Hub is based on [syohex/emacs-realtime-markdown-viewer](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-realtime-markdown-viewer).
